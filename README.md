# OpenLens - Easy Custom OCR Model

OpenLens is an open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) framework designed for simplicity and ease of use. The project aims to provide a user-friendly solution for training and inference of custom OCR models using the TRDG (Text Recognition Data Generator) library.

## Usage

### Installation

Install OpenLens and its dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install openlens
```

## Training a Custom Model
#### To train a custom OCR model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your custom dataset using the TRDG library.
Use the prepared dataset to train the OCR model with the OpenLens framework.
2. Fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance with your specific data.
3. Inference with the Trained Model


## Ethics
OpenLens promotes ethical use of OCR technology. Ensure that the data used for training and inference adheres to privacy and security guidelines. Respect intellectual property rights when applying OCR to sensitive or copyrighted materials.

## To-Dos


- [x] Implement a data preprocessing module to handle various data formats and improve model performance.
- [X] Integrate additional data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the OCR model.
- [x] Develop a comprehensive tutorial and documentation for seamless adoption of the OpenLens framework.
- [x] Establish community guidelines and best practices for responsible OCR usage and data handling.
